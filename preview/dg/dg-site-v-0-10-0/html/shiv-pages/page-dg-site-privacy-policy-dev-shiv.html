        <h5>WHAT ARE YOUR RIGHTS REGARDING YOUR DATA WITH US?</h5>

        <p>
          This Section summarizes the rights that you have under data
          protection law. Please note that some of the rights available to you
          are convoluted and may not be represented in detail in this Policy.
          We advise you to peruse the relevant laws for a complete
          understanding your rights. Your principal rights concerning your
          Personal Data under GDPR are as below:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Right to access:</strong> You have the right to confirmation
            as to whether or not we process your personal data and, where we do,
            access to the personal data, together with certain additional
            information. That additional information includes details of the
            purposes of the processing, the categories of personal data
            concerned and the recipients of the personal data.


            <p>
              Subject to the condition that the rights and freedoms of others are
              not affected, we will supply to you a copy of your personal data.
              The first copy will be provided free of charge, but additional
              copies may be subject to a reasonable fee. You can request your
              personal data with us, by emailing us on
              <a href="mailto:info@ducisgroup.com">info@ducisgroup.com</a>
            </p>

          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Right to rectification:</strong>You have the right to have
            any inaccurate personal data about you rectified and taking into
            account the purposes of the processing, to have any incomplete
            personal data about you completed.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Right to erasure:</strong>In certain circumstances you have
            the right to the erasure of your personal data without undue delay.
            Those circumstances include: the personal data provided to us is no
            longer necessary in relation to the purposes for which it was
            collected or otherwise processed; you withdraw consent to
            consent-based processing; you object to the processing under certain
            rules of applicable data protection law; the processing is for
            direct marketing purposes; and the personal data have been
            unlawfully processed.

            <br />
            <p>
              However, there are exclusions of the right to erasure. The general
              exclusions include where processing is necessary: for exercising the
              right of freedom of expression and information; for compliance with
              a legal obligation; or for the establishment, exercise or defense of
              legal claims.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>Right to restrict processing:</strong> In some circumstances
            you have the right to restrict the processing of your personal data.
            Those circumstances are: you contest the accuracy of the personal
            data; processing is unlawful but you do not desire erasure; we no
            longer need the personal data for the purposes of our processing,
            but you require personal data for the establishment, exercise or
            defence of legal claims; and you have objected to processing,
            pending the verification of that objection. Where processing has
            been restricted on this basis, we may continue to store your
            personal data. However, we will only otherwise process it: with your
            consent; for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims;
            for the protection of the rights of another natural or legal person;
            or for reasons of important public interest.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Right to object to processing:</strong> You have the right
            to object to our processing of your personal data on grounds
            relating to your particular situation, but only to the extent that
            the legal basis for the processing is that the processing is
            necessary for: the performance of a task carried out in the public
            interest or in the exercise of any official authority vested in us;
            or the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by us or by a
            third party. If you make such an objection, we will cease to process
            the personal information unless we can demonstrate compelling
            legitimate grounds for the processing which override your interests,
            rights and freedoms or the processing is for the establishment,
            exercise or defense of legal claims. You have the right to object to
            our processing of your personal data for direct marketing purposes
            (including profiling for direct marketing purposes). If you make
            such an objection, we will cease to process your personal data for
            this purpose.
          </li>

          <p>
            You have the right to object to our processing of your personal data
            for scientific or historical research purposes or statistical
            purposes on grounds relating to your particular situation, unless
            the processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried
            out for reasons of public interest.
          </p>
          <li>
            <strong>Right to data portability:</strong>To the extent that the
            legal basis for our processing of your personal data is: (a)
            consent; or (b) that the processing is necessary for the performance
            of a contract to which you are party or in order to take steps at
            your request prior to entering into a contract and such processing
            is carried out by automated means, you have the right to receive
            your personal data from us in a structured, commonly used and
            machine-readable format. However, this right does not apply where it
            would adversely affect the rights and freedoms of others.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Right to complain to a supervisory authority:</strong> If
            you consider that our processing of your personal information
            infringes data protection laws, you have a legal right to lodge a
            complaint with a supervisory authority responsible for data
            protection. You may do so in the EU member state of your habitual
            residence, your place of work or the place of the alleged
            infringement.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Right to withdraw consent:</strong>To the extent that the
            legal basis for our processing of your personal information is
            consent, you have the right to withdraw that consent at any time.
            Withdrawal will not affect the lawfulness of processing before the
            withdrawal.
          </li>
          <br />

          <p>
            You may exercise any of your rights in relation to your personal
            data by a written notice to us on info@ducisgroup.com. In order for
            us to comply with your request, your notice must clearly state the

            respect of which you wish to exercise such right. Please note that
            as a security measure, we may require you to verify your identity
            before accepting any request concerning your Personal Data.
