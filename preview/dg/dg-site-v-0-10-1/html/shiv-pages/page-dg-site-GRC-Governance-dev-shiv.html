      <p>Corporate governance refers to a framework of procedures, policies, and rules that are used to determine the
        overall performance and direction of the company. Organizations use this management approach for purposes of
        direct control. This framework is used because it ensures directives, instructions, and strategies are carried
        out effectively. On the other hand, compliance is a term used to describe the process through which businesses
        showcase they’ve conformed to requirements in contracts, regulations, policies, and laws.</p>
      <p>Corporate governance and compliance are linked. They fall under the umbrella term of governance, risk
        management, and compliance (GRC). Risk management represents a set of processes management uses to identify and
        analyze risks that may have an effect on the business objectives of the organization.</p>
