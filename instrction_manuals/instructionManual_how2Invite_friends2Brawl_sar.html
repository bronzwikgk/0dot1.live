                <h3>Requirements:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>A club that you are a part of in Brawl Stars.</li>

                    <li>Your friend is not currently in another club or meets the club's trophy requirements.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Step-by-Step Instructions:</h3>

                <h4>Step 1: Open Brawl Stars</h4>
                <p>1. Launch <strong>Brawl Stars</strong> on your device.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Make sure you are connected to the internet.</li>
                    <li>Log in with your account if needed.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Step 2: Navigate to the Social Menu</h4>
                <p>1. Once on the main screen of Brawl Stars, look for the <strong>Social</strong> icon.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>This is the button with three figures located on the right-hand side of your screen.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Step 3: Access the Club Tab</h4>
                <p>1. Tap the <strong>Club</strong> tab to access the club that you are currently in.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>This tab is also located within the Social menu, typically labeled as <strong>Clubs</strong>.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Step 4: Open Your Friends List</h4>
                <p>1. In the <strong>Social menu</strong>, tap the <strong>Friends</strong> tab at the bottom of the screen.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>This will display all the friends you have added in Brawl Stars.</li>
                    <li>Friends will be listed as either <strong>Online</strong> or <strong>Offline</strong>.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Step 5: Invite Friends to the Club</h4>
                <p>1. Scroll through your friends list and select the friend you wish to invite.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Tap on your friend's <strong>profile picture</strong>.</li>
                    <li>This will bring up their player profile.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>2. In their profile, there will be an option labeled <strong>Invite to Club</strong>.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Tap this option to send the invitation.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Note:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>If the <strong>Invite to Club</strong> option is not available, it could mean:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Your friend is already in another club.</li>
                            <li>Your club's trophy requirements are higher than your friend's current trophies.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Step 6: Adjust Club Trophy Requirements (Optional)</h4>
                <p>1. If your friend doesn’t meet the trophy requirements:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>You can lower the <strong>trophy requirement</strong> temporarily to allow them to join.</li>
                    <li>Go to your <strong>Club</strong> page, tap on the <strong>Settings</strong> icon, and adjust the required trophy count.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Step 7: Wait for Acceptance</h4>
                <p>1. Your friend will receive the invitation and can accept or decline it.</p>
                <p>2. If they accept, they will join your club and will be visible on the club member list.</p>

                <h4>Alternative: Invite from the Club Page</h4>
                <p>1. You can also invite members directly from your <strong>Club</strong> page:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Go to the <strong>Club</strong> page and tap <strong>Invite Members</strong>.</li>
                    <li>Search for your friend by their <strong>player tag</strong> or <strong>name</strong> and send them an invite directly.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Troubleshooting:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Invite button missing:</strong> Ensure your friend is not currently in another club.</li>
                    <li><strong>Trophy Requirement:</strong> Adjust the club’s trophy requirement if your friend doesn’t meet the threshold.</li>
                    <li><strong>Club full:</strong> If the club has reached its member limit, free up a slot or choose a different friend.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>FAQs:</h3>
                <p><strong>Q1. What if my friend is in another club?</strong></p>
